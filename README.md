# Waffle House API Closure Explorer

This repo is a WIP of providing maps and contextual information to see current Waffle House closures due to COVID-19.

Waffle House provides an API that can be searched to find closures. Luckily the API spits out a nicely formatted `geojson` format that can be readily imported into `geopandas` to look at.
